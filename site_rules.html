      <ol>
          <li>
              <h3>Respectful Conduct:</h3>

          <li>
              <h3>Original Content:</h3>
              <p>When posting memes, users should ensure that they are either original creations or properly credited if sourced from elsewhere. Plagiarism or claiming someone else's work as your own is prohibited.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>No Spoilers:</h3>

          <li>
            <h3>Appropriate Content:</h3>

          <h3>Stay On Topic:</h3>
          <p>Content shared on the site should primarily relate to Baldur's Gate 3. While some off-topic discussion might be acceptable, the focus should generally remain on the game and its related memes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>No Spam or Self-Promotion:</h3>
          <p>Refrain from excessive self-promotion or spamming of links, unrelated content, or advertisements. This includes repeatedly posting the same content or links.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Respect Copyright:</h3>
          <p>Users must adhere to copyright laws when sharing memes. Avoid using copyrighted material without proper permissions, and respect the intellectual property rights of others.</p>
        <li>
          <h3>Moderator Discretion:</h3>
          <p>Site moderators reserve the right to remove, edit, or take action against any content or user violating these rules. Their decisions should be respected and followed.</p>
